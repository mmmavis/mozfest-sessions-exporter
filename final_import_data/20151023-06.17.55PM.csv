There are at least 90 African tech hubs that serve as infrastructure to catalyze technology, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Not only do they act as physical infrastructure, providing access to power, internet, and space, but they also offer access to human, financial and social capital. By distributing these resources more efficiently, hubs make it easier to build start-ups, develop tech, and foster innovation.\nBut can hubs also create better solutions to complex social problems?

Participants in the session will identify the most scalable contributions to an open-source technology project (in particular) and co-construct a framework for engaging professional volunteers.\nThe perfect balance between a volunteer’s skills, availability and interests, and an organization’s needs is a tricky target to strike. When it is done successfully, there is a great mutual benefit to everyone involved. However, the most impactful contributions are those that provide a sustainable structure and enable an organization or project to scale.\nTogether with Mozilla designers experienced in limited-contribution, professional volunteer experiences and Mozilla educators experienced with community-based projects, participants will create an open, shared standard for structuring a professional volunteer engagements to maximize the success, impact, sustainability and scalability of a professional volunteer contribution."

Discovering the Web that exists behind their screens would help journalists, both young and old, realize that websites and data can and should be vetted and investigated, just like human sources. Non-journalists would also benefit from this session, because it would help them acquire and distribute data for a civic hacking purpose.

However, even across domains, similar patterns of requirements appear and it is often the case that the first thought is to buy closed software in that fulfil needs but often does not promote or allow open interoperability. This session will allow people to help build a toolbox of free/open source software needed to transition an existing “black box” research laboratory (that doesn’t share or collaborate on anything) into one that is more “open”. This can be used as a model/base for young researchers that want to encourage their lab to open up, but don’t know how to."	"Billy Meinke"	486

This includes everything from hardware, and calibration, to data aggregation and coding tools.\nThe idea of this workshop is to share our knowledge with one another about tools and especially about gaps in the tool chain, from the point of view of parents, teachers and students. Participants will get hands-on experience of an IoT stack, with hardware provided by us. The goal will be to come up with a wish-list and suggestions about how Mozilla Science can help."
