We set out to map the blank canvas of Tanzania using mobile apps (for locals on the ground), open data (of schools&medical facilities) and satellite mapping on OpenStreetMap (for volunteers around the world). The project has since seen major successes, including thousands of schools mapped, hundreds of objects&villages that were only known to locals identified etc. Currently, we are rushing to map the region of Mara, where female genital mutilation (FGM) is prevalent, before the cutting season starts in December. Mugumu Safe House is already using our maps to \"reach places they have never reached before\" and save more girls from the life threatening practice. Our goal for this session is to demonstrate how mapping can help achieve SDGs in developing countries, and illustrate how easy it is to contribute by doing mapping online.",

We need a paradigm shift that transforms institutions' mindsets, and that allows students to adapt to new learning environments that prepare them for future job.\nThis session will allow participants to get a taste of a hybrid course, and produce a design piece, with a face-to-face component.",

Session participants will hopefully also be inspired by the collaboration between students and industry, potentially leading to further partnership opportunities within the design and scientific communities. Finally the students who won the weather data project will also exhibit a special Moz Fest edition of 'Hack Circus' they co-created with the Met Office.",

Maps, case studies, and simple factsheets do a better job.\nLast year, Communia issued a policy paper on the importance of copyright exceptions. Now we present the best examples of exceptions found in national laws of MS, which could be a model for harmonization of users rights in the EU.\nThe biggest obstacle we faced when selecting those cases is that no one has an overview of the national exceptions. So, Kennisland mapped down those legal provisions. This helps to visualize the balkanization of solutions in the EU.\nThe session will present these projects as tactics used when advocating for copyright reform.",

But a parallel track is leveraging copyright and public policy to work for us by advocating for open licensing policies for publicly funded digital resources.\nThese policies, possible within existing copyright framework, are necessary to guarantee access and reuse of taxpayer funded materials like scientific research, educational content, data, and even software. Via EU initiatives like Horizon 2020 and Erasmus+, there’s a huge opportunity to take a giant leap forward in populating the commons with a wealth of content that can be freely reused by all.\nThe session will explore several examples where this is already beginning to work. We’ll highlight advocacy tactics used across open licensing policy projects, and encourage everyone to engage in this work alongside other activism in support of the open web.",

My ex-boyfriend broke up with me over a WhatsApp conversation – given the circumstances, breaking up in person would have been impossible, and so it happened over a cyberspace of floating words instead. From a very normal honeymoon phase to a very wretched constantly arguing phase to a very dramatic end; the relationship went through many phases in the span of nine months, a journey that is portrayed in my book. There were many moments through the wretched phase though, where there was a constant anticipation on my end. I was always waiting for a reply and when it would come it would be long and sometimes short, heart-breaking words, leaving me with a kind of “bam!\" Similar to the anticipation of when heating something up in the microwave, I was constantly in anticipation waiting for a reply, and when I heard back it was gut-wrenching words that broke my heart. I put Polaroids I photographed in the microwave, but what I photographed did not matter, it was what happened to the Polaroid once popped into the microwave that did. Burnt and damaged they resembled me through the wretched phase of my relationship. Everything through this time felt surreal; technology really gives people a means to disappear and this series of work is my memento of that.",

The painting is transformed into the audio domain and back to visual producing a contemporary amalgamation. As we pass through the various color/frequency layers, we investigate the connections between classical aesthetics and the digital practice, revealing a latent version of the old masterpiece. The final artwork is a contemporary amalgamation of the old painting and the modern abstraction methods, a harmonious dialog between the old and the new, the analog and the digital.",

The screen is then cleared and the process repeated. Each following full screen is uploaded along with all proceeding images in a batch, increasingly leaving an imprint on the Trump campaign.\nThe algorithm incorporates increasingly more versions of itself into its creations, essentially 'eating itself'.",

On the 3 light-sculptures the bots discuss the need for an autonomous network architecture, in which each bot focuses on their own specialty. The connection between the panels (bots) goes via a self developed open source autonomous communication network that uses Bluetooth Low Energy as infrastructure.\nEach bot reacts on each other via a custom build library. These reactions create an ever-changing script about the topics. These scripts imitate the unstable constellation of the current communication infrastructure. More and more of the data that runs through communication networks is automatically generated data (internet of things). Machines talking to machines. This installation recreates this on a small scale discussing current and important topics about dependencies on the current mass communication structures.",

The perceptible motion of the particles is similar to biomorphic and synthetic biological forms that connect to an unknown original universal matter and its procedural inception. They slowly and gently draw mesmerizing figures, according to stochastic rules. The result, hypnotic and mind-bending, is a brilliant example of the aesthetics of code. The sound composition uses digital signal processing to create shamanic rhythms of high intensity. The interconnected cells resemble processes in nature, from the origin of light to the creation of matter, in an unpredictable way, due to accidental movement.

Badges that you don’t realise that’s what they’re doing when you’re earning them.\n#BadgeSkills at O2’s ThinkBigHub this week highlighted:\nThe potential badges can offer alternative routes into and through employment.\nThat resilience and ‘mental toughness’ come up again and again as something employers need in our workforce.\nThat most businesses currently recruit by measuring the wrong qualities (Roger Phily, The Chemistry Group)\nIs it possible that badges can offer an alternative route to value what employers need, but also to develop, recognise and evidence this too?\nThe later in life you experience failure, the bigger the fear. To really develop mental toughness, kids need to be losing their fear of failure at age 6/7/8. But whatever your age (as I’ve personally recently realised) it’s never too late, and can be liberating.",

Built using open source tools and incubated in the 2015 open research accelerator at Mozfest, miniReproducibility allows users to submit their own data or any open access figure; annotate and display them non-hierarchically to visualize the experiments and methodologies side-by-side. This provides visibility to the data that is often buried in the middle of a paper. Submitters whether they be readers, publishers, and scientists build a user profile dedicated to methodology and reproducibility using open badges.",

Using a simple browser, phone, and low-cost camera, individuals who otherwise would not have access to VR technology are equipped to build personalized immersive experiences using 360 photos and videos, text, and audio. Using these media primitives, users can create customized stories, games, and learning resources.

Participants use a 3v battery, copper tape and low-profile LED circuit stickers from Chibitronics – solderless, peel-and-stick electronics modules for crafting circuits – to introduce illumination as a design element in the activity.",

Our session would be an interactive demonstration and test of our website, and hopefully, the launch of a new piece of Escalate software. Currently, Escalate has limited features, allowing users to listen to audio recordings of scales on different instruments, allowing the user to see the scale notation and having a backing track from a popular song that allows users to improvise with the new scale, but at MozFest, we hope to launch several new Escalate features.",
