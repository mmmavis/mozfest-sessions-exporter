Technology has affected knowledge in such a way as to diminish the value of “raw” information and increase the value of sense-making, as well as chip away at attention spans, sparking a need for distillation of complex ideas. Images can essentialize the cumbersome in beautiful ways. They have a “stickiness” for the viewer and challenge the critical thinking of the creator.\nThis hands-on session offer participants an opportunity to tinker and play with:\nmetaphorical thinking, iconography, pictograms, emoji, typography, sketchnotes and photography.\nWe’ll experiment with ways to use visual language for critical thinking, social interaction and creative expression",

There are at least 90 African tech hubs that serve as infrastructure to catalyze technology, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Not only do they act as physical infrastructure, providing access to power, internet, and space, but they also offer access to human, financial and social capital. By distributing these resources more efficiently, hubs make it easier to build start-ups, develop tech, and foster innovation.\nBut can hubs also create better solutions to complex social problems? Many tech hubs are engaged in developing tech solutions for education, health, and governance challenges. However, there is an opportunity to push past “there's an app for that” thinking and reconceive tech hubs as creative spaces that foster tech-enabled, innovative problem solving.",

The first project, a partnership with Beyond Differences, is designed to address root causes of negative behavior by working with schools to promote inclusion and kindness.  The second project, working with the Tyler Clementi Center for Law & Policy at NY Law School, will provide education and resources to students, families, lawyers and judges as well as a first-of-its-kind law clinic dedicated to helping victims of online harassment.

High school students across the US began tweeting #HandsUpWalkOut--they were planning a national student walkout to protest police violence against people of color. This wasn’t organized by a formal organization, just high school kids on social media. That night I made the first version of “Day of Action” and put it on HandsUpWalkOut.com. Over the next two days,  student organizers used the app to coordinate 100+ walkouts & related actions. The tool provides a workflow for adding a local event and generates a map so others can find local actions. Thousands of people participated and the tool was used 100k times that weekend.",

They can bubble up interesting content in an easily shareable form that works on most devices. In this session, learn to create and publish your own animated video from scratch. We will also explore Adobe Expressions, a javascript like language, for coding your animation behaviors in a video.\nThis session is good for beginners new to making videos as well as for people with some experience in video production looking to add animation to your skill set.\n*Prerequisites:*  A working installation of Adobe After Effects and Adobe Photoshop. You can get a free 30-day trial from Adobe Creative Cloud at http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/desktop-app.html. Instructions for installing After Effects and Photoshop are here: https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/help/manage-apps-services-desktop.html.

Discovering the Web that exists behind their screens would help journalists, both young and old, realize that websites and data can and should be vetted and investigated, just like human sources. Non-journalists would also benefit from this session, because it would help them acquire and distribute data for a civic hacking purpose.

    "description": "To gather women who are interested in creating a community to increase the web literacy of girls. Girls are too shy to explore coding because they initially think that it's interface is too masculine. This session's goal is to create a Mozilla Club designed for girls. And help them see technology in a whole new light – as a medium for self-expression, and as a means for changing the world. This will be a brainstorming session on how to persuade women to be more involved in web literacy in the means of establishing Mozilla Clubs. And how to create more effective events that will make them stay and would want to reach out to more people."

In this interactive, non-intimidating session you'll create a \"dream job\" based on what you're good at and what you like to do. You'll also hear a diverse panel share how they parlayed their skills and passions into a dynamic -- and often self-defined -- role in the tech industry. A great session for MozFest newbies, youth, and anyone considering transitioning their careers into this exciting field. Everyone is welcome!"
